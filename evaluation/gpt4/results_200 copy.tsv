projections based on the globocan 2012 estimates predict a substantive increase to 19.3 million new cancer cases per year by 2025 , due to growth and ageing of the global population . south africa , like other developing countries , is also experiencing an increase in the overall burden of disease attributable to cancer , with the number of new cancer cases predicted to increase by 46% by 2030 . this is likely to result in an increase in the use of cancer chemotherapy agents , which assist in preventing the proliferation , invasion , and metastases of the cancer cells . the basis for chemotherapy is anticancer drugs containing platinum , that is , cisplatin ( cis - diamminedichloroplatinum ii ) and carboplatin ( cis - diammine 1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylatoplatinum ii ) . other chemotherapy drugs include nitrogen mustard , amino - nicotinamide , dichloromethotrexate , bleomycin , and 5-fluorouracil [ 5 , 6 ] .","islatin- associatedotoxicity is  major for patients with cancer, as the hearing may be affected  the quality of life, the of  hearing, and the impact on quality life. this is to the  of ofcplatin totoxicity,  and its in and of in  patients  with  cancer.  isis-  toxicity  associated the loss hearing in children, adolescents, adults, in,,","cplatin- associatedotoxicity has been reported to be a major problem in the treatment of cancer, as it is known that the toxicity ofclatin is associated with the generation of reactive species, the of of s - ps and ts, and the effects of islatin on totoxicity are not limited to the use of chemotherapy, but also to other drugs, such as op latin, is the most effective in treating cancer"
68,"the synthetic modification 
 of proteins enables the construction 
 of biomolecular hybrids that can be used to study protein function , deliver potent therapeutics to cellular targets , and build new materials . the synthesis of these constructs requires a suite of chemoselective 
 bioconjugation reactions that proceed under mild , aqueous conditions 
 in the presence of the native functional groups that are present on 
 protein surfaces . the most common methods for protein modification 
 target the nucleophilic side - chains of lysine and cysteine . however , these strategies can 
 result in complex product mixtures , as lysine is typically found in 
 high abundance on the protein surface and 
 uniquely reactive cysteine labeling sites can be difficult to install 
 in many instances ( such as thiol proteases and proteins produced via 
 the eukaryotic secretory pathway , for example ) . many newer approaches 
 for the site - selective modification of proteins 
 involve the introduction of artificial amino acids with reactivities 
 that are orthogonal to those of the native
