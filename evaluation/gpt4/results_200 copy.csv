projections based on the globocan 2012 estimates predict a substantive increase to 19.3 million new cancer cases per year by 2025 , due to growth and ageing of the global population . south africa , like other developing countries , is also experiencing an increase in the overall burden of disease attributable to cancer , with the number of new cancer cases predicted to increase by 46% by 2030 . this is likely to result in an increase in the use of cancer chemotherapy agents , which assist in preventing the proliferation , invasion , and metastases of the cancer cells . the basis for chemotherapy is anticancer drugs containing platinum , that is , cisplatin ( cis - diamminedichloroplatinum ii ) and carboplatin ( cis - diammine 1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylatoplatinum ii ) . other chemotherapy drugs include nitrogen mustard , amino - nicotinamide , dichloromethotrexate , bleomycin , and 5-fluorouracil [ 5 , 6 ] .","islatin- associatedotoxicity is  major for patients with cancer, as the hearing may be affected  the quality of life, the of  hearing, and the impact on quality life. this is to the  of ofcplatin totoxicity,  and its in and of in  patients  with  cancer.  isis-  toxicity  associated the loss hearing in children, adolescents, adults, in,,","cplatin- associatedotoxicity has been reported to be a major problem in the treatment of cancer, as it is known that the toxicity ofclatin is associated with the generation of reactive species, the of of s - ps and ts, and the effects of islatin on totoxicity are not limited to the use of chemotherapy, but also to other drugs, such as op latin, is the most effective in treating cancer"
68,"the synthetic modification 
 of proteins enables the construction 
 of biomolecular hybrids that can be used to study protein function , deliver potent therapeutics to cellular targets , and build new materials . the synthesis of these constructs requires a suite of chemoselective 
 bioconjugation reactions that proceed under mild , aqueous conditions 
 in the presence of the native functional groups that are present on 
 protein surfaces . the most common methods for protein modification 
 target the nucleophilic side - chains of lysine and cysteine . however , these strategies can 
 result in complex product mixtures , as lysine is typically found in 
 high abundance on the protein surface and 
 uniquely reactive cysteine labeling sites can be difficult to install 
 in many instances ( such as thiol proteases and proteins produced via 
 the eukaryotic secretory pathway , for example ) . many newer approaches 
 for the site - selective modification of proteins 
 involve the introduction of artificial amino acids with reactivities 
 that are orthogonal to those of the native

the control of microbial contamination generally involves clean - in - place ( cip ) procedures which consist of running alternated cycles of detergent and disinfectant solutions with water rinses in high turbulence regimes through the plant and pipeline circuits without dismantling or opening the equipment [ 25 ] . biocides are currently used in industrial processes as the most significant countermeasure to control microbial growth and proliferation . industry moved progressively towards the use of surfactants that are less toxic and more biodegradable .
surfactants are classified according to the ionic physiognomies of their hydrophilic group as anionic , cationic , nonionic , and zwitterionic [ 6 , 8 ] . quaternary ammonium compounds ( qacs ) are cationic surfactants that are commonly used because of their hard - surface cleaning , odor removal and antimicrobial properties .",the ofm activity of acs and tab in the presence ofy and ha was   factor  inactiv ofp. fluescen and the bacterial  consortium  was by the ination  ofa c solution  the activity the thes of theass  andc s were  by  decrease the oxygen up in rate  this was the case forbac cere and consortium exposed tobac tab ,"the microbial activity of bac and cs was investigated in the absence of intering substances, and the results of the studies were ed by the use ofa - s, a- and- ins, the antim activity was determined the the of ofs and in. the ination of bacteria was d to the surface of water, which is the most important for the control ofm bacteria, as the bacteria are used in"

psychiatric epidemiologic studies have tended to emphasize microlevel stressors ( e.g. , stressors in individuals ' role domains ) and , until recently , have ignored the linkages between macrolevel social forces and the daily stressors in people 's lives [ 79 ] . however , macrolevel social conditions can affect the magnitude of stressors experienced in people 's lives and the extent to which they experience  cumulative adversity  .",", the cgr is  measure of drinking in the context of the great recession. this is the first of  series  that examine the of ofcoping the the effects macro  related stressors the drinking  and drinking outcomes. thess   isa measure alcohol consumption the past  month, and the is of importance to the relationship drinking drinking and stress  the present sample.  in this  we the","the present study was conducted in the united states betweenjun, 2010, andjanary, 2011. the s of the study is a qualitative study that examines the relationship between - stressors and drinking and the use of coping strategies to the extent that they are able to cope with the consequences of recession, such as the loss of job, the of of income, unemployment, lack of health, poor health and social insts, social and"

, this treatment modality may successfully restore the functional and esthetic impairments caused by tooth loss3 . in spite of the significant evolution of a number of implant systems , implant design and features , such as those related to the mechanical behavior of implant - supported prostheses ,

193,"the central nervous system ( cns ) represents an important target for hiv infection during multiple stages of the disease : early , after invasion of the host , since the virus rapidly enters the cns , which then constantly acts as a viral reservoir ; lately , subverting its function and causing peripheral neuropathies and neurocognitive disorders ; and lastly , during the final stage of neuroaids , triggering opportunistic cns infections , cancers , and dementia ( tardieu and boutet , 2002 ) .
highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) , a combination of drugs that inhibits enzymes essential for hiv replication , can reduce the viremia and the onset of opportunistic infections in most patients , and prolong the survival ( see table 1 ) . although haart has reduced the incidence of clinical signs of neurological disease in hiv - infected individuals , autopsy studies suggest that there has been no corresponding decline in the incidence of inflammatory lesions in the cns . haart currently in use in the clinical practice . among the limits of the current treatments
the most noticeable is the inability to eradicate hiv - infected cells , both , limiting the time frame in which haart initiated after exposure to hiv can prevent infection , and allowing replication - competent virus that persists in infected cells to emerge rapidly after the cessation of haart . according to those considerations
, there is evidence that haart is less effective in lowering virus replication in the cns than in the blood ( gisolf et al . , 2000 ) ; and haart resistant viruses are more often found in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) than in biological samples ( cinque et al .","the of  v- inf  cells  the ns  is  target forv  infection,  and the effects ofv on neuros are  of great  importance. gk  inhibitors have been in  clinical  for years, but have not been  effective thecs hi infection. in this  we the thes of ofga and k inhibitor  to the in of virus in cells",", the a of s - cs and ns are important for the control of disease, and the of of the in and in of cells, which are infected by v, is the most important in the treatment of diseases, as it is known that es, d,,d and are able to inhibit the replication ofv in cells and thus, to the, of and of, in. m,s"
