43,"neurosurgery is characterized by the delicate balance between surgical success and potential for devastating side effects . thanks to multiple technological improvements
, the morbidity of neurosurgical interventions has substantially decreased over the last decades , allowing for the resection of previously inoperable lesions . in particular , image - guided neurosurgery ( igns ) devices allow the use of coregistered and fused multimodality 3d images to guide the surgeon 's hand and help define preoperatively the boundaries of pathological and predefined functional structures . meanwhile
, new modes of medical imaging have also improved the localization of pathological lesions and their characterization . medical imaging nowadays includes a wealth of different techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( smri and fmri ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , and positron emission tomography ( pet ) .","this is  new   method, and we present the of of- the- art for updating preoperative images  the brain des due  shift and successive sections. this  is the first of  series  that the  mechanical is in the state of update  we  present our d approach,  which the the displacement of thees and thes ofse are  in  state  of and  to  and","in section 4, we present the - of- the- art of re and traction, which is a method that is used to determine the of the deformation in the brain, and to the extent that it is not possible to obtain the information on the shape and the position the ins and outs of brain. the method is the combination of mechanical and mechanical methods, based on e m s, the use ofa d ",2.0,2.0
44,"the contribution to human health of the specific fatty acid ( fa ) composition of the diet has received considerable attention in the literature . fatty acids are key nutrients that affect early growth and development as well as the prevention of chronic disease in later life.1 among the fas , omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3 pufa ) and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-6 pufa ) have been suggested to decrease and increase several human diseases , respectively . pufa that contains more than one carbon double bond consists of two major classes such as n-6 and n-3 ( fig . linoleic acid ( la ) is a representative n-6 pufa , serving as a substrate to be converted into an arachidonic acid ( aa ) affecting the prevalence and severity of inflammation . n-6 pufa can induce cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cancer , and age - related disease.1

. internal fixation of these fractures necessitates the use of acromioclavicular joint spanning implants ( clavicle hook plate , synthes , usa ) that overcome distraction forces by subacromial leverage ; however , subacromial / acromioclavicular joint encroachment with these implants is associated with subacromial pathology , and this may negatively influence the final outcomes . to overcome the shortcomings of the joint - spanning implants , acromioclavicular joint - sparing implants ( 2.4 mm lcp distal radius plates , synthes , usa ) have been suggested . additionally , a combination of this implant with some form of coracoclavicular fixation using sutures / anchors / endobutton devices ( tightrope , arthrex , fl , usa ) has been recently described for use in the highly unstable fracture subgroup . however , comparative clinico - radiological outcomes of the two techniques are lacking in literature .","croioclavcular is  type  of fracture  the ofacromi oicular   joint  in cs  and ac  fractures,  with  high rate ofcomution, and high of ss ( t  score ).am ii isa  pattern fracture, the pattern the theai of the m fracture. ic  iss pattern","acroioclavcular fracture was observed in 3 patients ( group 1 ), and the - s of cromi clav joint was ed in group 2 ; m : o i and c . t l d r p n b  ands  ( v) of theamoiclavi joint (a) and (b) were in the of",2.0,1.4
